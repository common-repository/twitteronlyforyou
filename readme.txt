*Note #1: I might not get back to you immediately.* This software is written and supported by an individual, not a company or a group.

*Note #2: Please don't flame me for bugs.* Twitter is notoriously unstable and has some bugs in the API. On top of it, I use jQuery library that has some bugs in it as well. On top of it you might have other plugins installed that have bugs or introduce conflicts. Finally, 90% of the code works within browsers which have all sorts of different bugs of their own. Before calling TweetBlender "crap" give it a benefit of a doubt - it might not be its problem. I'm really striving to make it the best it could be
